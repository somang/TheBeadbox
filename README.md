The Beadbox - ToDo List
==========
TODO list for the project starting 2014 Sept. 28

## What's left?
April 25th 2015







# Functionalities...To do...
- - Undo & Redo 
- - Copy & Paste

- Virtual Input instrumental/device/window UI 
(i.e. virtual Vibrochord, Computer Keyboard mapped, etc)

- Import wav files, Export multi-track audio file
- Load the composition file, File Format






## Synopsis

Vibrotactile as an art genre, the Beadbox aims to support the novice artists who wants to create a vibrotactile art composition of their own. Similar to music/movie editors, but using a unique notation system, the Beadbox has its default setup for the Emoti-Chair. (http://www.ryerson.ca/psychology/emotichair.html)


## Classes
- This requires (and includes) Java Asio library (jsio)
- Also MIDI library APIs

## Motivation or Background
The Beadbox is a composition or notation software for Vibrotactile art.
The Vibrotactile technology has four essential components to be used.
* Frequency Control
* Intensity (Amplitude) Level Control
* Timing (Time, duration) Control
* Spatial Information (Where does this output contactor positioned)

### Research Questions
1. How can a novice user who does not have any previous education in computer programming or music, can create a vibrotactile composition?
2. What is the impact of using a dedicated software for vibrotactile composition?
3. Will the dedicated software be viable to the users?
4. What is the protocol for the vibrotactile data?
5. What is the usability of the vibrotactile composition tool for allowing users to control over the frequency, intensity, timing, and spatial information?

## Installation, prerequisites.
Java 1.8.x

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
