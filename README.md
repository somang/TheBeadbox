The Beadbox - ToDo List
==========
TODO list for the project starting 2014 Sept. 28

## What's left?
* selecting precision?

* Longer notes: Draw two lines to connect two beads.
  - If one of the bead gets deleted, the line is deleted.
  - The other bead stays while the selected bead gets deleted at first place.
  - 
  

* Color palette: http://www.sron.nl/~pault/ and Google up CUD palette. (Colour Universal Design)

* The tracks should be available for zoom in and zoom out.
* Each bead(note) has 40ms duration.
  - The maximized zoom will contain each note, with one in each cell.
  - How would you time it? How do I know? UHHHH

 
 

















# Functionalities...

- Play, Pause whole composition
- Note(Bead) Entry 
- - Undo & Redo - Copy & Paste

- Layout: Move notes freely
- Concept of Time: Timeline for playing
- Virtual Input instrumental/device/window UI 
(i.e. virtual Vibrochord, Computer Keyboard mapped, etc)
- Frequency Control, Intensity/Amplitude Control
- Separate Multi-track Output/Play

- Import wav files, Export multi-track audio file
- Save the composition
- Load the composition file, File Format

- Visualization for 





















## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation or Background
The Beadbox is a composition or notation software for Vibrotactile art.
The Vibrotactile technology has four essential components to be used.
* Frequency Control
* Intensity (Amplitude) Level Control
* Timing (Time, duration) Control
* Spatial Information (Where does this output contactor positioned)

### Research Questions
1. How can a novice user who does not have any previous education in computer programming or music, can create a vibrotactile composition?
2. What is the impact of using a dedicated software for vibrotactile composition?
3. Will the dedicated software be viable to the users?
4. What is the protocol for the vibrotactile data?
5. What is the usability of the vibrotactile composition tool for allowing users to control over the frequency, intensity, timing, and spatial information?

## Installation, prerequisites.

Java 1.8.x

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
